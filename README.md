Barbershops as Community Spaces for Bitcoin Education:

Barbershops in Zambia are more than just places for groomingâ€”they serve as social hubs where people gather, exchange ideas, and engage in conversations. This project will make use of communal setting to introduce Bitcoin education in a casual and approachable manner. By training barbers on Bitcoin fundamentals and equipping them with simple educational materials, they can organically spark discussions about Bitcoin with their clients. 

With strategically placed Bitcoin-themed posters, stickers, and wall art, these barbershops will become micro-learning centers where people can ask questions, share insights, and gain practical knowledge on how to use Bitcoin in their daily lives.
